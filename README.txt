#######RESPONSIVESNESS#######
Firstly, to make this website responsive, I have used the meta tag responsible for adjusting the web contents to the sreen that it is being viewed on.
Secondly, I have only used percentages and viewport-based dimensional units (vw and vh) for defining the size-related styling for all the elements.
I have also made use of CSS flex box on the index page for the discography list and image slideshow. I have also created two media queries, 
that resize and adjust certain elements of the webpage to suit the dimensions of the viewport.
