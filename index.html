                <br>
                <h3>Career</h3>
                <p>Neffex (stylized as NEFFEX) is an American music project composed of Bryce Savage (born Brandon Horth) and formerly Cameron Wales. They produce remixes and original songs characterized by a mixture of electronic and rap genres. Savage
                    wrote lyrics and sings whereas Wales used to create the instrumental and did the editing. They have released many of their songs royalty-free.</p>
                    <br><p> Savage and Wales first met in high school when they were 15 years old. At that time,
                    they were involved in a punk rock band. Thereafter, both exited the band and started making their own music. However, this was not yet the creation of Neffex. After high school, Wales moved to Los Angeles and got distant from Savage
                    during college. When Savage was in the last year of college, he talked to Wales and they noticed both were making music in their free time.</p>
                    <br><p>After college, they got together again, in Orange County, and created the name "NEFFEX"
                    and the fox symbol. In 2017, the duo set up a challenge for releasing 100 songs in 100 weeks. All songs released for this challenge are royalty-free. On October 16, 2019, they released their first EP titled Q203, named after the apartment
                    where they recorded their first songs. The album has six songs: When I Was Young, Without You, It's My Life, Sunday, Primal, and Want Me. On September 25, 2020, they released their debut album titled "New Beginnings" featuring ROZES,
                    Jez Dior, and MASN. The album has 16 songs: Sometimes, Be Somebody, New Beginnings, Scars, I've been Let Down, Hell Won't Take Me, I Wanna Play A Game, Don't Hate Me, Mind Reader, Unavailable, When It Flows, WOW!, Worst of You, Closer
                    to Heaven, Space, and I'll Be Fine. On July 6, 2021, they mutually decided to part ways and each one focus on solo projects and Wales left NEFFEX. On July 7, 2021, Savage set up a challenge for releasing 100 songs in 100 weeks again
                    and same as before, all songs released for this challenge are royalty-free</p>
